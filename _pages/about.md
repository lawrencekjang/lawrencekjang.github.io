I am currently a Visiting Researcher on the Llama Computer Agents team at Meta with [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/)and an incoming Machine Learning PhD student at Carnegie Mellon Unviersity.  I am broadly interested in LLM agents. 

At CMU, I have been grateful to collaborate with [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/), [Prof. Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io/), and [Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/). I recently completed my [5th Year Master's in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/5th-year-ms.html) from Carnegie Mellon University and also completed my undergraduate degree from CMU in Statistics and Machine Learning.  I have done internships at Microsoft Research, the Chicago Cubs, and the MLB Commissioner's Office.

I am passionate about teaching and have been involved with many course offerings at CMU as a teaching assistant, including [10-703 Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://cmudeeprl.github.io/703website_f23/), [10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://andrejristeski.github.io/10708-S23/schedule.html), and [11-777 Multimodal Machine Learning](https://cmu-mmml.github.io/).  I was the 2024 Statistics Department Undergraduate TA of the Year and 2024 Machine Learning Department TA of the Year. 

In my free time, I like to play basketball and cook Korean food. I am happy to talk about collaborating - email me!
