I am a [5th Year Master's in Machine Learning Student](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/5th-year-ms.html) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am broadly interesting in common-sense reasoning in multimodal agents, particularly within applications of memory and visual grounding. My research interests also include the intersection of reinforcement learning and LLMs.

At CMU, I have been grateful to collaborate with [Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/), [Prof. Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io/), and [Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/). I also completed my undergraduate degree from CMU in Statistics and Machine Learning. 

I am passionate about teaching and have been involved with many course offerings at CMU as a teaching assistant, including [10-703 Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://cmudeeprl.github.io/703website_f23/), [10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://andrejristeski.github.io/10708-S23/schedule.html), [11-777 Multimodal Machine Learning](https://cmu-mmml.github.io/), [36-401 Modern Regression](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat401/), and  [36-402 Advanced Data Analysis](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/24/).  I was also the 2024 Statistics Department TA of the Year. 

In my free time, I like to play basketball, cook Korean food, and travel. Feel free to reach out on email about anything!
