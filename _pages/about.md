I am in a [5th Year Master's in Machine Learning Student](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/5th-year-ms.html) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am broadly interesting in common-sense reasoning in multimodal agents, particularly within applications of memory and visual grounding. My research interests also include the intersection of reinforcement learning and LLMs.

At CMU, I have been grateful to collaborate with [Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/), [Prof. Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io/), and [Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/). I also completed my undergraduate degree from CMU in Statistics and Machine Learning. I will be applying for CS PhD programs in the Fall 2025 cycle. Feel free to reach out on email about anything!
